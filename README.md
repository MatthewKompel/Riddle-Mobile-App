# A mobile app that generates a Random Riddle Daily

Developed using the MERN stack, this project allowed us to explore the possibilites of mobile development while creating a fun game at the same time. 

A huge databse of riddles is stored in MongoDB, and using a CRON function that runs every midnight, the riddle is refreshed globally for all users to try. 

Player accounts are tracked so that each user may access their statistics and usage history.
